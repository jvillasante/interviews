## Chapter01 - Arrays and Strings
### Question01 - Is Unique
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
What if you cannot use additional datastructures?
### Question02 - Check Permutation
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other.
### Question03 - URLify
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that
the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and
that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java,
please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

Example
```
Input:  "Mr John Smit     ", 13
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
```
